# Zukies-Dookies-Backend
Backend for Zukies Dookies

## List of technologies to look at:
* Django
* API (Comic Vine, thdogapi/dog-api)
* MySQL
* Google Maps Integration
* Framework that sorts a table?
* React Native - React Native Table Components
* Deployment - Probably not heroku

## Zukies Dookies

### User Story
As a dog owner, I want to be able to effectively track the wellness of my dog, so that I can stay on track with their vaccination schedule and also use details about my dog's poops to know if I need a vet, provide accurate information to my vet, or know if my dog responds better to certain foods. 

### MVP
- Create a User  
- Create a Dog owned by a user  
- Be able to record vaccinations for the dog  
- Be able to track how recent medicines have been given  
- Be able to track daily poops and what food the dog is eating at that time  

### Stretch Goals
- Add Google Maps for local vets  
- Allow a person to share their dog with another user, so that a dog walker can record poops as well  
- Sort Framework to be able to list out poops for different foods/dates/etc
