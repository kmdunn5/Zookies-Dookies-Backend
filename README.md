# Zookies-Dookies-Backend

Backend for Zookies Dookies

## List of technologies to look at:

- Django
- API (Comic Vine, thdogapi/dog-api)
- MySQL
- Google Maps Integration
- Framework that sorts a table?
- React Native - React Native Table Components
- Deployment - Probably not heroku

## Zookies Dookies

### User Story

As a dog owner, I want to be able to effectively track the wellness of my dog, so that I can stay on track with their vaccination schedule and also use details about my dog's poops to know if I need a vet, provide accurate information to my vet, or know if my dog responds better to certain foods.

### MVP

- Create a User
- Create a Dog owned by a user
- Be able to record vaccinations for the dog
- Be able to track how recent medicines have been given
- Be able to track daily poops and what food the dog is eating at that time

### Stretch Goals

- Add Google Maps for local vets
- Allow a person to share their dog with another user, so that a dog walker can record poops as well
- Sort Framework to be able to list out poops for different foods/dates/etc

This is the react version of Zookies Dookies. This app features the following technologies:

- Flask
- Flask Login
- React
- Axios
- React Data Table Components
- Material UI
- Styled Components

This app allows the user to log in and/or create an account. Then they can add a dog to their list, and then track some of the medical information for their dog. This will also include the dog's poops!

## Problems I Ran Into

- Too much time spent on data structure
- started react native, didn't have time enough for that
- Too many routes to add into react
- got caught on a lot of small problems
- decided to focus on material ui too late

## Future Features

- Ability to add defaults to poop details
- Upload pictures
- Update dookies, meds, vaccines (and dog)
- Make the show dogs button instead show a random dog and a set number
- Update mobile responsiveness
